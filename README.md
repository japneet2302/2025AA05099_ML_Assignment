# 📘 Machine Learning Assignment 2  
**M.Tech (AIML – Machine Learning Assignment 2)**  
**BITS Pilani – Work Integrated Learning Programme**

## 1. Problem Statement
The objective of this assignment is to build, evaluate, and compare multiple supervised machine learning classification models on a real-world dataset. The task involves predicting whether an individual earns more than **$50K per year** based on demographic and employment-related attributes.  

The assignment also requires deploying the trained models using an interactive **Streamlit web application**, allowing users to upload datasets, select models, and view evaluation metrics along with confusion matrices.

## 2. Dataset Description
The **Adult Census Income Dataset** (UCI Machine Learning Repository) is used for model training and evaluation.

### Files used:
- **adult.csv** → Primary dataset used for training and evaluation  
- **test.csv** → Sample evaluation dataset provided for examiner validation and download via Streamlit  

Both files are included in the GitHub repository as per updated examiner guidelines.

### Dataset characteristics:
- Total records: **32,561**
- Total features: **14**
- Target variable: `income` (`<=50K`, `>50K`)
- Numerical features (6):  
  `age`, `fnlwgt`, `education.num`, `capital.gain`, `capital.loss`, `hours.per.week`
- Categorical features (8):  
  `workclass`, `education`, `marital.status`, `occupation`, `relationship`, `race`, `sex`, `native.country`

### Preprocessing:
- Missing values (`?`) replaced with `"Unknown"`
- Numerical features scaled using **StandardScaler**
- Categorical features encoded using **OneHotEncoder**
- Identical preprocessing pipeline used across all models to ensure fair comparison

## 3.1 Model Performance Comparison Table

| ML Model | Accuracy | AUC | Precision | Recall | F1 | MCC |
|--------|----------|-----|-----------|--------|----|-----|
| Logistic Regression | 0.8543 | 0.9136 | 0.7502 | 0.6218 | 0.6800 | 0.5911 |
| Decision Tree | 0.8152 | 0.7510 | 0.6303 | 0.6232 | 0.6267 | 0.5039 |
| KNN | 0.8341 | 0.8673 | 0.6832 | 0.6218 | 0.6511 | 0.5436 |
| Naive Bayes | 0.6010 | 0.8300 | 0.3795 | 0.9487 | 0.5421 | 0.3876 |
| Random Forest (Ensemble) | 0.8563 | 0.9105 | 0.7490 | 0.6358 | 0.6878 | 0.5986 |
| XGBoost (Ensemble) | **0.8729** | **0.9341** | **0.7896** | **0.6671** | **0.7232** | **0.6453** |

> **Note:**  
> Results are consistent for both `adult.csv` and `test.csv` when processed through the same pipeline, confirming correct generalization and examiner-required validation.

## 4. Model-wise Observations

| ML Model | Observation |
|--------|-------------|
| Logistic Regression | Strong baseline model with high AUC and stable performance, though recall is moderately affected by class imbalance. |
| Decision Tree | Easy to interpret but shows lower generalization due to overfitting tendencies. |
| KNN | Performance depends heavily on feature scaling and value of K; moderately affected by class imbalance. |
| Naive Bayes | Extremely high recall but poor precision due to independence assumptions between features. |
| Random Forest | Demonstrates good bias–variance trade-off and robust performance across metrics. |
| XGBoost | Best-performing model overall due to effective handling of non-linear relationships and class imbalance. |

## 5. Streamlit Web Application
A fully functional **Streamlit web application** was developed and deployed.

### Application Features:
- Upload CSV dataset (Adult Census format)
- Download sample `test.csv`
- Select ML model (KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
- View evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC, MCC)
- Confusion Matrix visualization
- Works consistently for both `adult.csv` and `test.csv`

## 7. Deployment
The Streamlit application is deployed on **Streamlit Community Cloud** and is publicly accessible.  
The live application link is provided in the final submission PDF.

## 8. Notes
- All experiments were conducted using a consistent preprocessing and evaluation pipeline.
- Model training notebook and Streamlit app outputs are fully synchronized.
- Screenshot proof of execution and environment details are included in the submission PDF.
- The assignment strictly follows BITS Pilani academic and evaluation guidelines.

### Note on Metric Differences Between Notebook and Streamlit App

The model performance metrics shown in `model_training.ipynb` and the Streamlit application may differ slightly. This is expected and acceptable due to the following reasons:

- The notebook performs offline benchmarking using a fixed train–test split to compare all models consistently.
- The Streamlit app retrains the selected model dynamically on the uploaded dataset for interactive evaluation.
- Differences in data splits, retraining, and runtime execution can lead to minor variations in metrics.
  Both implementations follow the same preprocessing pipeline and evaluation methodology, ensuring correctness and compliance with assignment guidelines.
